The data acquired from https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data, containing multiple xlsx files for each separate month from October 2018 to September 2019, was merged into a single xlsx file. It contains each BlueBikeâ€™s trip duration in seconds, start time and date, stop time and date, start station id and name, start station latitude and longitude, end station id and name, end station latitude and longitude, bike id, user type (either a single user or regular member), user birth year, user gender, and an added column for the year and month.
