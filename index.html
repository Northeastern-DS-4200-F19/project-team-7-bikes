    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p>
    	<em>
    	Currently, the bike lanes available for cyclists traveling through Chester Square area are too narrow and too close to incoming traffic for cyclists to feel safe. In addition, the availability of decent parking spaces for them are scarcely limited from our observation, which is why there might not be many cyclists in the area. Something else we discovered during our site visits, was that there are currently 5 BlueBikes stations neighboring the Chester Square area. We decided to investigate these stations further for their usage data in order to determine whether cyclists are making use of these stations as an alternative to having their own bikes.
    	</em>
	</p>

    <p>
    	<em>
    	By looking into the hourly usage of each BlueBikes station as well as the breakdown of whether or not these trips were taken by subscribers or non-subscribers, we were able to recognize a trend of mainly subscribers in the Chester Square neighborhood. BlueBikes subscribers typically have shorter trip durations because they are utilizing the service as an alternative to a ~20min walk. Bluebikes customers generally have longer trip durations, because they tend to want to make as much use out of their rented time as possible. As a means to increase bike usage and alleviate some of these cyclists' worries, we created our visualizations in a way that highlights the short but frequent trips taken at these stations. We wanted to make an argument it might be a feasible option for Bluebikes to have another station in this area as a means to further increase bike usage for the subscribers in the nighborhood.

      			Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.

      		</p>-->

    		<p>
    			<em>
    			The original data was retrieved from the <a href="https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data">BlueBikes System Data</a>. On the website, data for each month was contained within separate zipped csv files that were later merged as a part of the data cleaning process.
  				</em>
  			</p>

  			<p>
  				<em>
  					Data Cleaning:
  				</em>
  			</p>

  			<ul>
  				<li> 
  				Only the datasets from October 2018 until September 2019 were included in this analysis. Additionally, the only stations that were included in the final analysis were the four station closest to Chester Square (Tremont Street at Northampton Street, Columbus Avenue at Massachusetts Avenue, Washington Avenue at Rutland Street, and the South End Library). Overall, the data from BlueBikes' website was pretty clean, and most of the "cleaning" process mostly constituted of creating multiple datasets from the larger one to create each of our visualizations.
  				</li>
  				<li> 
  				In order to create a comprehensive dataset of the past year of BlueBikes use, we combined each of the 12 datasets into one, using R. After this, a variable yearmonth, which stores the date of the trip as a String in the YYYY-MM format, was created.
  					<ul>
  						<li>
  						<strong>Demographics data:</strong> A derived variable that represents the user's age, based on the provided birth year variable, was created. Then, the data was grouped and the number of records in the dataset was counted based on gender, average age, and membership type for each month of the past year (Oct 2018-Sept 2019). 
  						</li>
  						<li>
  						<strong>Station data:</strong> Two variables were derived from the starttime and stoptime variables, representing only the hour at which the trip occurred. Then, the large dataset constituting of data from all of Boston was filtered based on the station id for the four BlueBikes stations of interest (Tremont St at Northampton St, Columbus Ave at Massachussetts Ave, Washington St at Rutland St, and at the South End Library) and these smaller datasets were then filtered based on the start or end hour of the trip for each station.
  						</li>
  					</ul>
  				</li>
  			</ul>

      	<h1>Task Analysis</h1>

      		<p>
      			<em>
      			Summary of task table.
      			</em>
      		</p>

      		<p>
      			<em>
      			Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain problems.
      			</em>
      		</p>

		<h1>Design Process</h1>

      		<p>
      			<em>
      			We decided to create our visualizations using bar charts because we felt that made the most sense given the data types we are working with (see Data Analysis for more info.). The bar charts used for each of the 4 Bluebikes stations clearly show the growth in number of trips that occur hourly througout the day. In addition, having a solid red line that represents all Boston data makes it easy to understand how one station's trips contributes to the cities' total trips as a whole. It is also easy to notice changes in number of trips over time. 

            Our second visualization that contained our data types for Bluebikes demographics uses a grouped bar chart instead in order to illustrate our observation that there are more subscribers in the Chester Square area, who often tend to take frequent, shorter trips, which means that it could be beneficial for these kinds of customers to have another Bluebikes station they could frequent. 
      			</em>
      		</p>

      	<h1>Conclusion</h1>

      		<p>
      			<em>
      			Our work provides insight on the four closest and most relevant BlueBikes stations neighboring the Chester Square area. We visualize the hourly usage at these four stations in a given day and provide a comparison of each station to the hourly usage at all the BlueBikes stations in Boston. We also present a breakdown and comparison of the demographics of BlueBikes users for the past year, including user age, user gender (self-reported), and user type as either member or nonmember. Our visualization offers an analysis of Chester Square neighborhoodâ€™s relationship with BlueBikes, and whether it could be a feasible option to establish a station in the neighborhood. 
      			</em>
      		</p>

      		<p>
      			<em>
      			Future improvement could include expanding the hourly usage analysis to more than just the four stations near Chester Square. In this way, the hourly usage of BlueBikes stations in another neighborhood in Boston, analogous to the layout of Chester Square, could be analyzed and compared to that of Chester Square. Another future improvement could include visualizing the demographics of BlueBikes users for the past five years instead of being limited to the past year. In this way, the change in user demographics could be discussed in order to address how Chester Square neighborhood fit into that.
