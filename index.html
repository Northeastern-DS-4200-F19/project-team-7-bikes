    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p>
    	<em>
    	Currently, the bike lanes available for cyclists traveling through Chester Square area are too narrow and too close to incoming traffic for cyclists to feel safe. In addition, the availability of decent parking spaces for them are scarcely limited from our observation, which is why there might not be many cyclists in the area. Something else we discovered during our site visits, was that there are currently 5 BlueBikes stations neighboring the Chester Square area. We decided to investigate these stations further for their usage data in order to determine whether cyclists are making use of these stations as an alternative to having their own bikes.
    	</em>
	</p>

    <p>
    	<em>
    	By looking into the hourly usage of each BlueBikes station as well as the breakdown of whether or not these trips were taken by subscribers or non-subscribers, we were able to recognize a trend of mainly subscribers in the Chester Square neighborhood. BlueBikes subscribers typically have shorter trip durations because they are utilizing the service as an alternative to a ~20min walk. Bluebikes customers generally have longer trip durations, because they tend to want to make as much use out of their rented time as possible. As a means to increase bike usage and alleviate some of these cyclists' worries, we created our visualizations in a way that highlights the short but frequent trips taken at these stations. We wanted to make an argument it might be a feasible option for Bluebikes to have another station in this area as a means to further increase bike usage for the subscribers in the nighborhood.

    <h1>Visualization</h1>

    <p>
    	<em>
    	Include the interactive visualization as part of this page. Static example follows.

    <!-- Your visualization here -->
    <div class="vis-holder">
    	<!-- Change viewbox to whatever you want, e.g. "0 0 1000 6000" This determines your aspect ratio and coordinate system -->
     	 <!-- Delete all the sample SVG code below after the viewbox to before the closing tag. Populate this part of the SVG with D3. -->

    			The original data source was found in the <a href="https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data">BlueBikes System Data</a>. On the website, data for each month was contained within separate zipped csv files that were later merged as a part of the data cleaning process.

  				<li> Only the datasets from October 2018 until September 2019 were included in this analysis. Additionally, the only stations that were included in the final analysis were the four station closest to Chester Square (Tremont Street at Northampton Street, Columbus Avenue at Massachusetts Avenue, Washington Avenue at Rutland Street, and the South End Library). </li>

      	<h1>Conclusion</h1>

      		<p>
      			<em>
      			Our work provides insight on the four closest and most relevant BlueBikes stations neighboring the Chester Square area. We visualize the hourly usage at these four stations in a given day and provide a comparison of each station to the hourly usage at all the BlueBikes stations in Boston. We also present a breakdown and comparison of the demographics of BlueBikes users for the past year, including user age, user gender (self-reported), and user type as either member or nonmember. Our visualization offers an analysis of Chester Square neighborhoodâ€™s relationship with BlueBikes, and whether it could be a feasible option to establish a station in the neighborhood. 
Future improvement could include expanding the hourly usage analysis to more than just the four stations near Chester Square. In this way, the hourly usage of BlueBikes stations in another neighborhood in Boston, analogous to the layout of Chester Square, could be analyzed and compared to that of Chester Square. Another future improvement could include visualizing the demographics of BlueBikes users for the past five years instead of being limited to the past year. In this way, the change in user demographics could be discussed in order to address how Chester Square neighborhood fit into that.
