      <h1>Motivation</h1>

      <p>
      	<em>
          Currently, the bike lanes available for cyclists traveling through Chester Square area are too narrow and too close to incoming traffic for cyclists to feel safe in the lanes. In addition, the availability of decent parking spaces for them in the Chester Square area are scarcely limited from our observation, which are possible explanations as to why there appears to not be many cyclists in the area. Something else we discovered during our site visits, was that there are currently five BlueBikes stations neighboring the Chester Square area. We decided to investigate these stations further to analyze their usage in order to determine whether cyclists are making use of these stations as an alternative to having their own bikes. BlueBikes offers public access to their system data of all BlueBikes trips since 2015 to allow people to use their data for any type of analysis and visualization.
      	</em>
  	</p>

      <p>
      	<em>
      	We first analyzed the five relevant BlueBikes stations around Chester Square as a single data set that acts as the representative BlueBikes data set for the Chester Square area as a whole. We looked into the hourly usage of the Chester Square BlueBikes stations and compared that to the average hourly usage for all BlueBikes stations in Boston. By examining this hourly analysis, along with a breakdown of trips taken by BlueBikes members versus non-members for each hour, we were able to recognize a trend of mainly members in the Chester Square neighborhood. As a means to analyze bike usage for an average day in Chester Square, we created our visualizations in a way that highlights the trips taken to and from these stations. We also wanted to make an argument that it might be a feasible option for Bluebikes to establish another station within the Chester Square area as a means to further increase bike usage for the members in the nighborhood. This is why we also visualized the BlueBikes user demographics for all of Boston in order to provide insight as to how or whether Chester Square residents fit into the BlueBikes user demographics in Boston. By considering the usage of the Chester Square BlueBikes stations along with the demographics of BlueBikes users in Boston, we explore the possibility of establishing a new BlueBikes station to better accomodate Chester Square residents and their biking transportation needs with an end goal of promoting bike usage as a whole.

              <ul>
                <li> Demographics Data </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li> <strong>Age:</strong> This chart is a line chart because of the fact that it is exploring how a quantitative variable (average age) changes over time. The specific points are visible in order to distinguish the points that have been plotted from the connecting line itself. These points have no fill color initially to make it clear to the user which months they have brushed over. </li>
                    <li> <strong>Membership Status:</strong>  This chart is a grouped bar chart because we wanted to illustrate the significant difference that exists between members and non-members in the Chester Square area. The y-axis represents the number of users that frequented that station and the x-axis represents the month of the year that value is corresponding to.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Gender:</strong>  This chart is a grouped bar chart because we wanted to display the gender breakdown for the stations in the Chester Square area as another means of analyzing demographic data. Similarly, the y-axis represents the number of users that frequented that station and the x-axis represents the month of the year that value is corresponding to.</li>

                The trip information for the Chester Square stops is represented by a bar chart so that it is easy to see the peaks in Bluebikes usage. A line chart representing Bluebikes usage across Boston so that the usage of the five stations of interest is shown as comparable to that of Bluebikes in general, highlighting that it is a well-used service in the Chester Square neighborhood.

    		<p>
    			<em>
    			The original data was retrieved from the <a href="https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data">BlueBikes System Data</a>. On the website, data for each month was contained within separate zipped csv files that were later merged as a part of the data cleaning process.
  				</em>
  			</p>

  			<p>
  				<em>
  					Data Cleaning:
  				</em>
  			</p>

  			<ul>
  				<li>
  				The datasets from October 2018 until September 2019 were included in this analysis for the BlueBikes demographics data to observe BlueBikes demographics change over a period of time. Only the datasets from October 2018 until September 2019 were included in this analysis for the BlueBikes station data, as many BlueBikes stations were only established within the past year. Additionally, the only stations that were included in the final analysis were the five stations closest and most relevant to Chester Square to provide the best represenation of the BlueBikes influence in the area - (Tremont Street at Northampton Street, Columbus Avenue at Massachusetts Avenue, Washington Avenue at Rutland Street, Washington St at Lenox St, and the South End Library). Overall, the majority of the data from BlueBikes' website was clean, and the "tidying" process for our analysis mostly constituted of creating multiple datasets from the larger one in order to contrive aggregate data to create each of our visualizations.
  				</li>
  				<li>
  				In order to create a comprehensive dataset of the past year of BlueBikes use, we combined each of the 12 datasets into one, using R. After this, a variable yearmonth, which stores the date of the trip as a String in the YYYY-MM format, was created. All irrelevant columns were removed.
  					<ul>
  						<li>
  						<strong>Demographics data:</strong> A derived variable that represents the user's age, based on the provided birth year variable, was created. Because the birth year field on the BlueBikes sign up form is optional, some fields were null. In addition, some inputted birth dates were unreasonable such as 1889, so we decided to set any birth years before otherwise oldest birth year, 1933, to null. Then, the data was grouped for each month of the past year (Oct 2018-Sept 2019) and the number of records in the dataset was counted based on gender, average age, and membership type. Our age, gender, and users data sets contain the ordinal variable for each month and year. Our age data set contains a quantitative variable for average age. Our gender data set contains quantitative variables for gender counts (male, female, or unreported). Our users data set contains quanititative variables for user type counts (member or non-member).
  						</li>
  						<li>
  						<strong>Station data:</strong> Two variables were derived from the starttime and stoptime variables, representing only the hour at which the trip occurred. Then, the large dataset constituting of data from all of Boston was filtered based on the station id for the five BlueBikes stations of interest (Tremont St at Northampton St, Columbus Ave at Massachussetts Ave, Washington St at Rutland St, Washington St at Lenox St, and at the South End Library) and this data set was then filtered based on the start or end hour of the trip for each station (Oct 2018-Sept 2019). Our end and start hour data sets contain the quanititative variables for either the hour at which the trip ended (end_hour), or started (start_hour). They also contain the quantitative variables for member count (for BlueBikes members), non-member count (for BlueBikes non-members), and total count. In order to compare the BlueBikes station data to the data of all BlueBikes stations in Boston, we converted what we originally had as hourly trip counts into percentages (the percentage of trips of an average day that occur during each hour; ratio of hourly trip count over all trips of the day count) using R and Excel.

      			Summary of task table.

      		</p>-->

					<p>
						<em>
							Our project addresses three main domain tasks:
						</em>
					</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Determine the feasibility of adding another BlueBikes station in the Chester Square area in order to promote and increase bike usage</li>
					<li>Contrast the number of cyclists in the area with memberships as opposed to non-members (BlueBikes)</li>
					<li>Identify the BlueBikes user demographics in order to understand the relation with Chester Square resident demographics</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<em>
						Our main goal is to address a possibility for placing a BlueBike rental station somewhere within Chester Square to solve the lack of bike parking stations if that is a reason why there aren’t many cyclists in the area. Additionally, we want to find out if having a BlueBike location in Chester Square would encourage residents to bike more, reducing the number of vehicles in the area. We thought that people might be discouraged to do this right now, as there is currently an additional commute to pick up a BlueBike at neighboring locations. However, by placing a new BlueBikes station in Chester Square, we can better target and accomodate Chester Square residents and improve bike usage specifically within the residents.
					</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>
						In order to determine the feasibility of adding another BlueBikes station in Chester Square, we first look at the Chester Square area’s current interaction with BlueBikes by analyzing the hourly usage of BlueBikes in Chester Square and comparing this with the hourly usage of BlueBikes in all of Boston. We also analyze BlueBikes user demographics to address feasibility, which we go into in our last point.
					</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>
						In order to contrast cyclists with BlueBikes memberships and without BlueBikes memberships, we breakdown the trend of BlueBikes members and non-members in Boston in our demographics data along with the breakdown of average percentage of BlueBikes members versus non-members at any given hour of the day in our BlueBikes station bar graphs.
					</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>
						In order to identify the BlueBikes user demographics, we analyze the average age of BlueBikes users, the self-reported gender of BlueBikes users, and the type of BlueBikes users, over time over the past few years. This can be compared to the Chester Square resident demographics to address the feasibility and potential for future success of establishing a BlueBikes station in Chester Square.

		<h1>Design Process</h1>

      		<p>
      			<em>
      			We decided to create our visualizations using bar charts because we felt that made the most sense given the data types we are working with (see Data Analysis for more info.). The bar charts used for the 5 relevant Bluebikes stations (starting and ending station) clearly show the growth in number of trips that occur hourly througout the day. In addition, having a solid red line that represents all Boston data for all the stations in Boston makes it easy to understand how one station's trips contributes to the cities' total trips as a whole, and also easily allows for comparison between the BlueBikes stations in Chester Square versus all the BlueBikes stations in Boston. A toggle button allows for the user to switch between the hourly usage when trips start in Chester Square versus when they end in Chester Square. The toggle button allows for less clutter on a single screen and makes it not overwhelming for the user as there is no need to compare starting and ending station, but it is meaningful to have both. It is also easy to notice changes in what hour/hours of the day contain the greatest percentage of daily trips. We also implemented a tooltip that provides a member versus non-member breakdown of trips. For each hour, the tooltip details the percentage of trips that were taken by members and percentage of trips that were taken by non-members.
					</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>
            	Our other visualization that contained our data types for Bluebikes demographics uses a grouped bar chart in order to illustrate our observation that there are more members in the Chester Square area, which means that it could be beneficial for these kinds of users to have another Bluebikes station they could frequent. We also visualize the BlueBikes user demographics of age as a line chart and gender as another grouped bar chart in Boston in order to provide insight as to how or whether Chester Square residents relate with the BlueBikes user demographics in Boston, and addresses the feasibility of establishing a BlueBikes station in the area. Brushing and linking between the demographics data provides an easy comparison and link between age, gender, and type of BlueBikes users over time.
      			</em>
      		</p>
					<p>
						<em>
							Following usability testing, we were able to gain valuable feedback to implement changes that improve our features and the overall standard and effectiveness of our visualization. At first glance, some participants felt that there were too many station bar graphs, and the layout made it difficult to compare them or identify any differences between the different station bar graphs. Because the bar graphs for each individual station were not significantly different from each other, we decided to combine the five nearby stations as a single BlueBikes representation for Chester Square, and then compare this with the all Boston data. Some participants were also unsure of what and where each of the BlueBikes stations were. Therefore, to provide this contextual background, we decided to include a map of Chester Square that pinpoints the locations of each BlueBikes station being analyzed within our data set, along with the display of the name of the station when hovered over the point. We also added legends for each of our graphs in order to clarify what the different colors and lines meant. Another suggestion we got was to include annotations of textual descriptions before our visualizations to allow for clear transitions and provide any additonal contextual information a user might need. Some of our colors were dominating over others, and also were not aesthetically pleasing, so using colorbrewer online, we were able to revise our use of color to enhance our visualization. We were also able to revise the brushing and linking, and details on demand functionality that was not entirely successful during usability testing.

      	<h1>Conclusion</h1>

      		<p>
      			<em>
      			Our work provides insight on the five closest and most relevant BlueBikes stations neighboring the Chester Square area. We visualize the hourly usage at Chester Square BlueBikes stations in an average day and provide a comparison of this data to the hourly usage at all the BlueBikes stations in Boston. For each hour, we also provide the percentage of trips taken by BlueBikes members versus nonmembers. We present a breakdown and comparison of the demographics of BlueBikes users in Bostonfor the past year, including user age, user gender (self-reported), and user type as either member or non-member. We provide interactive functionality to link, highlight, and compare between the demographic categories for all BlueBikes users. Our visualization offers an analysis of Chester Square neighborhood’s relationship with BlueBikes, and whether it could be a feasible option to establish a station in the neighborhood, to better accomodate the transportation needs of Chester Square residents.

          <p>
            <em>
            Future improvement could include expanding the hourly usage analysis to more than just the five stations near Chester Square. In this way, the hourly usage of BlueBikes stations in another neighborhood in Boston, analogous to the layout of Chester Square, could be analyzed and compared to that of Chester Square. Another future improvement could include visualizing the demographics of BlueBikes users for the past five years instead of being limited to the past year, or having both data for the past five years and the past year to observe both change over a large period of time and seasonal change in BlueBikes user demographics. In this way, the change in user demographics could be discussed in order to address how well Chester Square residents fit into the demographics outlined.
